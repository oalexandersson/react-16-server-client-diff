I forked this project to highlight a (to me rather absurd) behavior in React 16.

If you add additional DOM nodes when rendering on the client, compared to what the server rendered, styles from the server rendering gets applied to your new DOM nodes.

I would understand if this could happen if the states were identical when rendering on server and client, but here I'm using a state change to cause this difference. Under this circumstance I find it absurd that the output is not what I last rendered on the client.

Please note that the hot-reloading triggers rerendering correcly. If the texts both have their stated color, a reload of the page will "fix" that for you.

The README below is the original project's README.

# React 16 SSR Template
This project provides a template for React 16 (Fiber) using server
side rendering.

*Important:* The master branch is only supposed to contain the bare-bone template.
There are different branches containing more advanced features, like streaming and 
more to come in the future. Those are documentented in the Branches section.

## Features
* Content served by ExpressJS using the EJS view engine
* Hot reloading of styles and scripts
* ESNext ready
* powered by webpack

## Branches
The following, more advanced, features are pushed to dedicated branches. 
Either checkout a specific branch or fork the repository and merge the branches to 
get the features you need. You might as well just use them as a resource to learn, how
the specific technologies are implemented.

### Streaming (feature/streaming)
Since React 16, we have the possibility to render to a node stream. This improves the time to first byte (TTBF), 
since the browser can display the app in an iterative manner. The dedicated branch provides the basic streaming 
implementation.

### React-Router Integration (feature/react-router)
For a template using [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) you can make use of this branch.
It features routing on client and server side as well as basic routes.

Thanks to [@crabbits](https://github.com/crabbits) for contributing this example.

### Express Routing / API (feature/express-routing)
This example shows how to configure routing ExpressJS. This can be used to create
an API to work alongside your frontend application.

### Redux (feature/redux)
This example shows how to integrate [redux](https://redux.js.org) along with server-side rendering
as well as hot-reloading. It features a simple store with preloaded state
from the server as well as state hydration on the client.

## Development
To start development, follow these steps:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rherwig/template-react-16-ssr.git
$ cd template-react-16-ssr
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

This fires up the development server on port `3000`.

You can now choose to either start developing your react application or
to enhance the express server according to your needs.

The react app's entry point is `src/shared/App.js` and the express
server is started from `src/index.js`.

For more information on how the specific parts of the application work,
please refer to the documentation in the code.

## Building for Production
In order to build for production and run the finished project, execute
the following:

```
$ npm run build
$ node public/index
```

This bundles and optimizes your app and runs it from the `public/`
directory.
